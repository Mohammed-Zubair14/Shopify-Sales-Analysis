This repository contains a Power BI dashboard for analyzing Shopify sales data using **dummy data** created solely for demonstration purposes. The dashboard showcases key e-commerce insights including total sales, order trends, product performance, and customer behavior. It is built using Power BI Desktop and leverages Power Query for data transformation and DAX for calculated metrics. The `.pbix` file provided includes mock datasets (orders, products, customers) structured to resemble real Shopify exports. Users can explore the dashboard as-is or replace the dummy data with their own Shopify exports by updating the data sources within Power BI. This project is ideal for showcasing data visualization skills, building portfolio projects, or serving as a starting point for custom Shopify analytics solutions.
